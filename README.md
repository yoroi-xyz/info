## 👋 Welcome to Yoroi!

Welcome to the early days of Yoroi! We're incredibly excited to start building this community and platform together. Our core mission is simple: **to build the ultimate toolkit for navigating and trading on Hyperliquid.**

We know we're just starting out (a small team with a growing Discord & Twitter!), but we have a clear plan and a big vision for what Yoroi can become. We aim to provide traders with unparalleled insights, powerful execution tools, and unique opportunities within the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 What We're Building NOW (MVP - The Foundation)

Our immediate focus is on delivering core tools that provide immediate value:

*   **🔎 The Explorer:** Gain unprecedented transparency with the ability to explore ALL open positions and historical trades of every trader on Hyperliquid. Find inspiration, analyze strategies, or just see what the market is doing in real-time.
*   **👥 Simple Copy Trading:** Found a trader you like via the Explorer? We're building a straightforward way to copy their trades directly within Yoroi.
*   **💻 Integrated Terminal:** Execute your trades on Hyperliquid smoothly through the Yoroi frontend, keeping your analysis and execution seamlessly integrated in one place.

### 🔭 The Bigger Picture: Where We're Headed (Future Vision)

Beyond the initial foundation, we envision Yoroi evolving into a comprehensive trading powerhouse:

*   **🤖 Advanced Trading Tools:**
    *   **Market Making:** Integrate and fine-tune tools like Hummingbot specifically for robust market making on Hyperliquid.
    *   **Grid Bots:** Implement configurable grid trading strategies.
    *   **HFT Backend:** Provide the infrastructure necessary for users to run their own custom High-Frequency Trading (HFT) scripts.
*   **🧠 Deep AI-Powered Analytics:**
    *   Leverage advanced AI models (Transformers, Recurrent Neural Networks - RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) to analyze the *entire* Hyperliquid blockchain history from day 0.
    *   **Goal:** Discover unique "gem" traders, uncover hidden profitable strategies, identify sophisticated market maker tactics, and understand deep market dynamics.
*   **📊 Comprehensive Market Data Aggregation:**
    *   Integrate crucial data from across the crypto landscape directly into Yoroi.
    *   **Examples:** Aggregated funding rates, open interest (OI), and Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) from major CEXs.
    *   Incorporate insights from platforms like CryptoQuant and real-time market sentiment analysis.
*   **🚀 Flexible & Advanced Copy Trading:**
    *   Go beyond simple mirroring. Enable copy trading based on specific trader cohorts (e.g., Retail, Market Makers, HFT Algos, Whales).
    *   Implement "anti-copying" strategies, such as fading low-equity wallets (e.g., < $1000) often associated with retail sentiment.
*   **🏆 Community, Gamification & Social Trading:**
    *   Make trading more engaging and collaborative.
    *   **Features:** PvP trading battles, clan systems, public leaderboards with tangible rewards.
    *   Introduce elements potentially themed around competitive PnL or strategy success (with a slight "gambling" feel for engagement).
